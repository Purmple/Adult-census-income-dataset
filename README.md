# Adult-census-income-dataset

Implement from scratch Decision Tree classification method to predict whether 
the incomes exceed $50K/yr based on census data. Thus, this is a binary classification problem. The training 
and test sets are pre-defined in the data set (i.e., in “adult.data” and “adult.test”).

Implement two DT models by choosing any two (2) split criteria from Information Gain, Gain Ratio, 
Gini Index and Variance.
